# NIDAR - Automatic Safety Detection
ML Hack and Tensorflow Dev Submit View Party

Public Safety is a major concern in today's society. Modern weaponry and firearms pose serious threat to the safety and security of the everyday people.

# Aim : 
An integrated system that process video data and detect presence of a firearm or other weaponry when used in a threatning or dangerous manner and inform the Police or the concerned authority.



# How to run:

1. Clone the current repository by
    git clone https://github.com/im-gozmit/NIDAR.git

2. Move to the current repository by 
    cd NIDAR

3. Run the requirements by
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt


# Work till now:

We have used Haar Cascade Classifier to detect the person as well as the Gun and then we have notified the concerned authoritity of the potential threat.

# Future Work:

1. Increasing the accuracy of the Image Detection by using faster models like R-CNN etc.
2. We can later use facial recognition to train our model so that we can easily detect the culprit using CCTVs.
